# OOP Project

As defined the [requirements](Requirements.pdf), this projects implements a simulation of a Squid Game.

Writing the implementation served to cement vital skills related to object-oriented programming:

 * Data encapsulation (constructors, getters, setters, avoidance of data redundancy)
 * Inheritance, Polymorphism
 * Exceptions
 * General code organisation and cleanness
 * Lifecycle of a C++ project using CMake. I have learned to use CMake to generate build scripts for multiple IDE's and OS's to enhance the portability of the project
